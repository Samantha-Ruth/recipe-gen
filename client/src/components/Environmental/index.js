        <h4>Decrease Greenhouse Gases and Production Energy</h4>
        <p>
          In the US, over one third of our food winds up in the landfill.
          According to the EPA, That's nearly 30 million tons per year. That's a
          lot of food!!! An enormous amount of resources go to waste, including
          the energy to grow, process, transport, and discard all that wasted
          food. Thatâ€™s not to mention the amount of methane food lets off when
          it winds up in landfills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Food waste is getting to be such a problem that states and cities are
          starting to restrict the amount of food waste going into the landfill.
          Get ahead of the game (and the compost) and create a delicious
          culinary creation from your random ingredients!
